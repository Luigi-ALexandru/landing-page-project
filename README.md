# landing-page-project

This section was the hardest by far. This project took me a few hours to make.

The first step was to learn the basics of Flexbox. Secondly, how to apply them. I'm trying to avoid as much as possible using block-box and use only Flex.
There are some parts that I find confusing, nesting boxes is easy at first but as you keep on building the site bigger, the more boxes you have nested
the easier it is to get confused. 

So far I'm happy with what I've created by I'm sure my code and the way I built this website as it is now, in the eyes of a good developer, is horrible.
I hope to get some tips on how to improve as I really want to learn how to properly use Flexbox. I'm just scratching the surface of it...
